# 213. House Robber II

## Analysis

Divide the circle into 2 linear arrays: 【 0, （1, 2, 3,...,n -1】, n\). The first part is **not** robbing the last house and the second part is **not** robbing the first house.

Notice these two cases are based on **not** robbing the first/last house rather than robbing one of them because it is possible that we shouldn't rob both of them.

## Code

### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int helper(vector<int> &nums, int left, int right){
        if (right == left) return nums[left];
    
        int first = nums[left], second = max(nums[left], nums[left+1]);
        for(size_t i = left+2; i <= right; i++){
            int temp = second;
            second = max(nums[i] + first, second);
            first = temp;
        }

        return second;
    }
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        if (len == 1) return nums[0];
        return max(helper(nums, 0, len-2), helper(nums, 1, len-1));
    }
};
```
