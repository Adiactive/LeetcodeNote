# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## Analysis

If text\[i\] = text\[j\], just add that element to the end of the longest common sequence in the previous part \(Part ONE\).

If not, the longest common sequence is the longest sequence between two parts which exclude i or j respectively \(Part Two and Part Three\).

When defining arrays, put one extra row and col and pad fill them with 0 to make the significant part work for the text1\[0\] and text2\[0\], cuz \[-1\] will raise an error.

## Code

### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int len1 = text1.size(), len2 = text2.size();
        int dp[len1+1][len2+1];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
        
        for(size_t i = 1; i <= len1; i++){
            for(size_t j = 1; j <= len2; j++){
                dp[i][j] = (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]) ? dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 : max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[len1][len2];
    }
};
```
