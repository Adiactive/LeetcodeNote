# 474. Ones and Zeroes

## Analysis

1. When there is no zero but only ones, if we count the number of ones in each string, it will be a common knapsack problem. For example, 

   ```text
   strs = ["1","1","1111","1","11"] m = 5
   ```

   the weight of each item is \(1, 1, 4, 1, 2\) and the values are \(1, 1, 1, 1, 1\). we need to find the most value with the weight limit of 5, so we have to choose more items, i.e. strings.

2. Adding zeros to strings is adding one more set of weights and limit, so we can treat it as two knapsacks and use a two-dimension array to store the results, dp\[i\]\[j\] means the largest subset formed by i zeros and j ones.

## Code

### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        int dp[m+1][n+1];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

        for(const auto& str : strs){
            int ones = 0, zeros = 0;
            for(const auto& ch : str){
                if (ch == '1') ones++;
                else zeros++;
            }
            for(int i = m; i >= zeros; i--){
                for(int j = n; j >= ones; j--){
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-zeros][j-ones]+1, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
