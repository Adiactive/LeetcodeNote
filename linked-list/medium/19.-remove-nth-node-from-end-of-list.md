# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Analysis

Use two pointers. First set the interval of these two pointers to n, then move the fast pointer to the end of the list. At this time, the slow pointer will be pointing to the nth node from the end.

## Code

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return nullptr;
        
        ListNode* first = head, *second = head;
        
        while(n--) first = first->next;
        
        if (!first) return head->next;
        
        while(first->next){
            first = first->next;
            second = second->next;
        }
        
        second->next = second->next->next;
            
        return head;
    }
};
```
