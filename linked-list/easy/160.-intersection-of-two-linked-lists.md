# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Analysis

Link the tail of each list to the head of the other. So if there's an intersection, the length of each pointer when they meet is both \(a part + b part + overlap\). If there isn't an intersection, they will go \(a + b\) length and meet at nullptr.

## Code

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode *a = headA, *b = headB;

        while (a != b){
            if (a) a = a->next;
            else a = headB;
            if (b) b = b->next;
            else b = headA;
        }
        
        return a;
    }
};
```
