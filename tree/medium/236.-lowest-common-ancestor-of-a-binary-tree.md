# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Analysis

Find the node for which p and q exist in its left and right subtrees respectively. Should  get NULL if p and q are both in the subtree of one side.

## Code

### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!root || root->val == p->val || root->val == q->val) return root;
        
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        
        return left ? right ? root : left : right ? right : NULL;
    }
};
```
