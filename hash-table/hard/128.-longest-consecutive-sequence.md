# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Analysis

For each element __x, find the longest consecutive sequence that starts with x. To achieve O\(n\) time complexity, store all the elements in an unordered set whose insert and search take up O\(1\). If x - 1 is in the set/array, skip the sequence finding loop to ensure that each element will only appear **once** in that loop.

## Code

### C++ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        
        for(auto num : nums){
            set.insert(num);
        }
        
        int maxLength = 0;
        for(auto num : nums){
            if (set.find(num-1) != set.end()) continue;
            int length = 1;
            while(set.find(++num) != set.end()) length++;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, length);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```
